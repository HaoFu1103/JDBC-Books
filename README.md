# JDBC-Books
The goal of this project is to use JDBC to create a Booksdatabase, populate it, and then execute different SQL statements to query or manipulate the Booksdatabase.


## Overview
In this project, using JDBC application that access an installed RDBMS (you need to have an account), you will need to:
* Create the Booksdatabase tables as specified in the schema definition below.
* Initialize the different tables (at least 15 entries per table) appropriately: all fields cannot be null.
* Issue the following SQL statements. For queries print the results from java into your console:
  * 1. Select all authors from the authorstable. Order the information alphabetically by the authorâ€™s last name and first name.
  * 2. Select all publishers from the publisherstable.
  * 3. Select a specific publisher and list all books published by that publisher. Include the title, yearand ISBN number. Order the information alphabetically by title.
  * 4. Add new author
  * 5. Edit/Update the existing information about an author
  * 6. Add a new title for an author
  * 7. Add new publisher
  * 8. Edit/Update the existing information about a publisher

## Guidelines
1. Open an issue when you start working on one of the queries
2. You can work on it in a fork or branch
3. Submit a PR when you finished and tested your code and want to merge
4. Update the To-Do accordingly
